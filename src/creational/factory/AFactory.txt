Factory Method is one of the most used design patterns in Java

In here we doesn't expose critical logic in the project to outer world

These logic can be access only through an interface or an abstract class

In this example Vehicle (super class) interface is used to create the objects.
But Car and Van subclasses will change it according to the way they want

Vehicle Factory is class responsible to create the objects needed for the VehicleFactory Demo class

Steps for Factory Design Pattern Implementation

1. Create Interface (Vehicle)
2. Create Concrete classes (Car, Van) from the interface
3. Create Factory class (VehicleFactory) to create objects as requested by the client
4. Implementation of the client request (VehicleFactoryDemo)
